# Manchester Challenge

<p align="justify">
Main project developed in collaboration with Manchester Robotics, as part of the undergraduate courses <strong>"Robotics Foundation"</strong> and <strong>"Intelligent Robotics Implementation."</strong>
</p>

## First Stage: ROS2 DC Motor Control

<p align="justify">
The goal was to control the speed of a DC motor attached to one of the wheels of the Puzzlebot — Manchester Robotics’ educational, differential-drive mobile robot.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Although velocity control for the Puzzlebot’s wheels will later use pre-built facilities provided by Manchester Robotics, it is essential to first understand the core control principles.
</p>

<p align="justify">
One approach is open-loop control, where voltage is applied in proportion to the desired speed. However, this method may not be robust enough, since it lacks self-correction.
</p>

<p align="justify">
For this reason, a closed-loop controller was used: a PID. By applying proportional, integral, and derivative terms, the system can reduce error over time. This ensures that the actual speed converges to the desired value.
</p>

## Methodology

<p align="justify">
Initially, two prototype nodes were created to test ROS2 functionality. The first node generated a sinusoidal signal, and the second acted as a signal processor. It subscribed to the signal generated by the first node, modified it, and published the processed signal. Both signals were visualized using <code>rqt_plot</code>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To implement this:
</p>

<p align="justify">
1. A ROS2 package named <code>signal_processing</code> was created.<br>
2. Inside this package, the <code>signal_generator</code> node was developed. It used <code>math.sin()</code> and a time variable <code>t</code> that incremented on each callback to compute a sinusoidal wave. The resulting signal was published on the <code>/signal</code> topic.<br>
3. Next, the <code>signal_processor</code> node was implemented. It subscribed to the <code>/signal</code> topic and applied modifications to the incoming signal: a phase shift (using a trigonometric identity), reduced amplitude, and an offset. The processed signal was then published to its own topic <code>/proc_signal</code>.<br>
4. A launch file was added to start both nodes and open <code>rqt_plot</code> for signal visualization.

</p>

<p align="justify">
After building the package, the full system can be launched with:
</p>

```bash
ros2 launch signal_processing signal_processing.launch.py
```

<p align="justify">
The <code>signal_generator</code> node later evolved into the <code>setpoint</code> node for a simulated PID control system. The simulation included three main nodes:
</p>

<p align="justify">
- <code>setpoint</code>: published speed references.<br>
- <code>controller</code>: subscribed to both the setpoint and simulated motor output, computed the error, applied the PID algorithm, and published the control signal.<br>
- <code>dc_motor</code>: simulated motor dynamics using a first-order model, received the control input, updated the speed, and published feedback.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The code was updated to load node parameters directly from the launch file and to allow real-time tuning using <code>rqt_reconfigure</code>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The reference node was extended to support both sinusoidal and square wave signals. The signal type can also be changed in real time through dynamic configuration.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A new launch file was created to start three sets of motor controllers. To improve robustness, node execution order was managed using services, following this sequence:
</p>

<p align="justify">
1. <code>dc_motor</code><br>
2. <code>controller</code><br>
3. <code>setpoint</code>
</p>

<p align="justify">
This setup allowed experimentation with PID parameters and performance evaluation before working with real hardware.
