# Manchester Challenge

Main project developed in collaboration with Manchester Robotics, as part of the undergraduate courses **"Robotics Foundation"** and **"Intelligent Robotics Implementation."**

## First Stage: ROS2 DC Motor Control

The goal was to control the speed of a DC motor attached to one of the wheels of the Puzzlebot — Manchester Robotics’ educational, differential-drive mobile robot.

Although velocity control for the Puzzlebot’s wheels will later use pre-built facilities provided by Manchester Robotics, it is essential to first understand the core control principles.

One approach is open-loop control, where voltage is applied in proportion to the desired speed. However, this method may not be robust enough, since it lacks self-correction.

For this reason, a closed-loop controller was used: a PID. By applying proportional, integral, and derivative terms, the system can reduce error over time. This ensures that the actual speed converges to the desired value.

### Methodology

Initially, two prototype nodes were created to test ROS2 functionality. The first node generated a sinusoidal signal, and the second acted as a signal processor. It subscribed to the signal generated by the first node, modified it, and published the processed signal. Both signals were visualized using `rqt_plot`.

To implement this:

1. A ROS2 package named `signal_processing` was created.
2. Inside this package, the `signal_generator` node was developed. It used `math.sin()` and a time variable `t` that incremented on each callback to compute a sinusoidal wave. The resulting signal was published on the `/signal` topic.
3. Next, the `signal_processor` node was implemented. It subscribed to the `/signal` topic and applied modifications to the incoming signal: a phase shift (using a trigonometric identity), reduced amplitude, and an offset. The processed signal was then published to its own topic `/proc_signal`.
4. A launch file was added to start both nodes and open `rqt_plot` for signal visualization.

After building the package, the full system can be launched with:

```bash
ros2 launch signal_processing signal_processing.launch.py
```
